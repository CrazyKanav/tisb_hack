Our code uses an algorithm to calculate the distance between teacher and student,
We use sql as a database to store the users. We have error pages for each error,  when your trying to sign up but email already exists it will give u an error and all the other errors. flask is not static, that everytime we had a new user, or a new teacher or a new subject it will automatically update it self.
To run the code you type python app.py in the terminal
